<center> <h2> Importance of sleep: </h2> </center>
<p> Sleep is one of the most important things you need to do for your body because it is your body’s way of recharging its batteries. When you begin to feel sleepy at night, it means that you have reached the limit that your body has, and you should sleep so that you do not over-exert yourself.
<br> <br>
    Many people don’t get enough sleep at night, mostly because so many of us have turned into night owls who love to do so many things at night instead of the daytime. These are terrible habits, and we must learn to get rid of them by paying attention to the importance of sleep. For example, a bad habit like this would be watching TV shows late at night despite knowing that we have to wake up early the next morning.
